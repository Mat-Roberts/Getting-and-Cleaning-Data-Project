# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

First, unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "Datafiles".

Make sure the folder "Datafiles" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.

run_analysis.R goes through all the files and: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. and creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
